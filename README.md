The files are the following:


## Data 

- data.Rdata: contains some pseudo data used for the illustrative example

## Code and Results

1. examplecode.R:  

 - description of the pseudo data and estimation of the proposed Causal Latent Transition (CLT) model.
  
 - Estimation of  the Difference-in-Difference standard models and of the Double Robust DiD model, and print the results.

2. sim_data.R: simulate data from the CLT model

3. simula_run.R: execute simulations
